# LabVIEWVoice-ColorID
This is the simulation and automation for a process of authentication (employees) and color recognition (tokens: white, red, blue) , in a conveyor belt system


SPECIFIC:

Implement Voice Recognition in a  system authentication.

Simulate an automation process using Labview that can be applied to a real context

Create a functional prototype of a  conveyor belt implementing MyRio, Arduino and a color sensor module.

Implement a PWM control using MyRio Daq to control a gearmotor

Implement a system for color identification using a TCS230 sensor and Arduino (LINX project for LabVIEW)
